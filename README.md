# Teko SvelteKit with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB

This repository contains the Transferarbeit (project work) from TEKO HF for integrating SvelteKit with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB, managed through Jenkins and containerization.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of SvelteKit, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, with ASP.NET Core, a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building web applications. MongoDB is used as the database system for storing and managing data. Jenkins is utilized for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, ensuring smooth deployment workflows. Containerization, possibly using Docker, is employed to enhance scalability and portability of the application. Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, while Sonarqube and Trivy are used for code quality and security analysis.
